# Add Razor Pages support to a .Net Core MVC Project

I wanted to take a default asp.net core MVC project in Visual Studio and then see if I could added razor pages support and use them both. 

I created an MVC project and compared it to a new razor project. Using insight from a  stack overflow article "[How to extend an ASP.NET Core MVC project by Razor Pages?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62863196/how-to-extend-an-asp-net-core-mvc-project-by-razor-pages)", I was able to successfully do just that. 

Using Visual Studio, Create new Project
select right project
name it
